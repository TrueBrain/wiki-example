# TrueWiki Data Example repository

This repository is an example of how your data repository can look.
By default, all TrueWiki really needs is an empty git repository, with at least
a valid main branch (so a single, possibly empty, commit is required).
After that, TrueWiki will fill it with the required folders and files as we go.

Additionally, `.truewiki.yml` can be added to configure the looks and feel
of the wiki.

See the commit history of this repository for an example.
